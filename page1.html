      <h1>Web Components: a tutorial with cats</h1>
      <p>Hello! I guess you're here to learn about web components.</p>
      <!-- If you're reading this comment, you can skip to the next <h2>! -->
      <p>I'd advise opening this article with your browser developer tools open, as the page itself has been written with web components, and unless your eyes have been augmented you probably wouldn't notice. Unless you're on IE11. Don't be on IE11. If you are, this page will probably be broken.</p>
      <p>Web components should be thought of as an umbrella for a set of three separate, but related standards</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Custom HTML</strong>: HTML elements you've designed yourself, with their own unique behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Shadow DOM</strong>: A piece of the DOM which has its own scope, isolating away things like CSS rules</li>
        <li><strong>Templates</strong>: Allow you to write HTML without attaching to the DOM.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>That what/why of web components</h2>
      <p>Since JS first arrived on the web, people have been using the web as an ever more sophisticated platform for software. Given the diversity of things people use, it is hard for the HTML spec to keep up with all the elements people want. To mitigate this, people use frameworks or libraries such as React or Angular to give them the power to create these more complex applications on the web by offsetting the limitations of HTML.</p>
      <p>Web Components can be thought of at their simplest level as HTML elements that you have created, unshackling you from the dictats of Tim Berners Lee and his henchmen. The great thing about them is that you can go on to use them over and over throughout your site on other pages, without worrying too much about what's already on the page, because they handily hide away CSS rules and JS variables, finally giving you the ability to scope your CSS and avoid some of the perils of global variables.</p>

            <cat-card cat="wall-cat"></cat-card> 
            <!-- WC exhibit number 2: and here, observe attribute different value.-->
